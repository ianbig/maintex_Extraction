A look at economic developments and activity in major stock markets around the world Monday:
___
LONDON — The Christmas travel season turned angry and chaotic as British officials struggled to clear snow and ice that paralyzed rail and air links and spawned cancellations and delays stranding thousands around the world.
More than 48 hours after Britain's last snowfall, some furious passengers with boarding passes for Monday flights were not even allowed into London's Heathrow Airport. Inside, piles of garbage grew and some people slept on terminal floors.
___
LONDON — Moody's Investors Service downgraded the ratings of five Irish banks, including some of the liabilities guaranteed by the government.
The downgrade followed Moody's Friday downgrade of Ireland's credit rating by five notches to Baa1, just three steps above junk-bond status.
Moody's said it cut the banks' ratings because of their reliance on the Irish government's support.
___
MADRID — Moody's rating agency warned that it could downgrade the debt rating of Spanish banks that might need help from the government to help them weather Europe's debt crisis and the nation's shaky economy.
Moody's Investor Service issued the warning a week after it put Spanish government debt on review for a possible downgrade amid unemployment of nearly 20 percent and grim growth forecasts following rounds of government austerity cutbacks.
___
BRUSSELS — The European Central Bank sharply reduced its purchases of bonds from vulnerable governments such as Greece, Ireland, or Portugal, despite pressure to do more to help fight the continent's crippling debt crisis.
In the week ended Dec. 17, the central bank spent only 603 million euros ($793 million) on government bonds, down sharply from 2.667 billion euros a week earlier and the lowest weekly amount since late October, data released Monday showed.
___
SEOUL, South Korea — Inter-Korean tensions, a longtime geopolitical risk in Asia, weighed on Asian stock markets.
South Korea's benchmark Kospi index dropped 0.3 percent. Elsewhere in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.9 percent, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.3 percent, the Shanghai Composite index slid 1.4 percent and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.5 percent.
Benchmarks in Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan and New Zealand also retreated, while those in India and the Philippines rose.
___
LONDON — Later in Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 closed up 0.4 percent, Germany's DAX was 0.5 percent higher and France's CAC-40 advanced 0.5 percent.
___
ATHENS, Greece — Greece's efforts to cut the bloated budget deficit are lagging behind annual targets although the shortfall has been cut by more than a quarter in the first 11 months of the year, the finance ministry said.
___
VENICE — Italy's traditional artisanal industries — glass, leather, jewelry, furniture — are under pressure, one risk factor for an economy that needs more growth to convince markets it can handle its large debt burden in years ahead and avoid being drawn into Europe's debt crisis.
___
GUANGZHOU, China — Automakers are forecasting strong China car sales in 2011 despite the end of some government incentives as the country's second major auto show this year kicks off in the southern city of Guangzhou.
___
MADRID — Spain should make tougher pension and labor reforms to revive economic growth and ease the debt load that is putting it at the heart of Europe's debt crisis, the OECD said.
___
LONDON — Mortgage lending in Britain hit a 10-year low in November, though credit to big businesses increased, highlighting the country's uneven and fragile recovery.
___
GENEVA — Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis AG says it plans to invest $500 million in Russia over a five-year period.
___
SHANGHAI — Communities in central and northern China are facing power cuts and rationing as winter coal supplies fall short of surging demand.
Cold weather and transport disruptions typically cause shortages most years, but the problem has been complicated by coal producers' unhappiness over price controls that are crimping their profits.
___
NEW DELHI — India's prime minister offered to be questioned by a parliamentary committee to prove his innocence in a telecommunications scandal that has shaken the government and reportedly cost the country billions.
___
BUDAPEST, Hungary — Hungary's central bank said it was raising its main interest rate from an annual 5.50 percent to 5.75 percent, citing heightened inflation risks.

Politicians dont really care about our overall stability as a nation.

Turns out Ross Perot was right about NAFTA and Bill Clinton was wrong.

The US war on drugs is costing a billion dollars a year. Legalize the dam stuff and tax the drug lords, traffickers and distributers.

Sadly, the U.S. is run by people who are lacking good analytical thinking skills.

With natural disasters, the Gulf oil spill, our current economic and healthcare situation, wars, terrorism, starvation, disease, devastation and loss, conflict amongst individuals, groups and nations at the forefront of global concerns, where are we headed as a planet? These problems know no boundaries and have reached unprecedented proportions. As a result, all aspects of our being have been challenged to the very depth of their core. How do we confront challenges of such enormity? Challenges that are out of control and that affect each of us on a global scale? Can we see that these problems are shared by all?

Do we hide under a rock until it is all over? Do we continue what we are doing and hope for the best? Can we remain in our comfort zone allowing our planet to fall apart while we sit idly by and do nothing? How long do you think your comfort zone is going to last when everything is crashing down around you? What will millions do without jobs and healthcare insurance? What will we do as the impending earth changes bring more natural disasters and more loss? How will we react as conflicts, wars, terrorism, starvation, devastation, and disease continues? How far do you think that we, as a planet, can go if we continue on the same path? 

How many times can we mend the massive wounds of our planet before we realize it cannot be fixed? It is not a boo-boo. You can’t put a band aid on it, kiss it, and make it better. We cannot fix it because it isn’t broken. It simply no longer works.

How much longer can we play the role of the “walking wounded”? How many disappointments and heartaches must a soul endure before we understand that it is time to move on? Can we wait around until there is nowhere left to go or is that time now directly upon us? Many of us have nowhere left to go, yet we still find ourselves struggling to live in the old. Can we understand that we have evolved well beyond that way of life? The Old is crashing, we must leave it behind.

Stop for a moment and consider the path that we are on. Are we part of the problem or are we part of the solution? What are you doing to make a difference in the quality of your life? What are you doing to make a difference in the quality of life for others? If you are still hanging onto every word , breath and promise of the media, society, our governmental and religious leaders, then I suggest you take a second look and see where we as a planet are going if we continue down this same path. We must look to one’s self to make a change, not only in the quality of life for one’s self but the quality of life of others.

Is our current situation a challenge or an opportunity? Have we reached an end or a beginning? It is all, but none. It is a challenge, it is an opportunity, it is a beginning and it is an end. It is what we choose to see and what we choose to do. The choice rests entirely upon each individual. It only becomes a challenge if we do not work together to find the solutions. It only becomes an end if we do not work together to create something new, different, and better. If we choose, it is a challenge with no end. If we choose, it is an opportunity to start over and create a new beginning. What will you choose?

Isn’t it time we became the solution and not the problem? What are we focusing on? If we are focusing on the problem, we will never find the solutions. Do we understand that we now have an opportunity to start over and create a new beginning?

If we can remember cherished moments spent with our loved ones. Smiles, hugs, and kisses from our little ones, even when we scolded them. Love, caring and understanding from our loved ones, even when we thought we were wrong. A warm embrace, a kind heart, a tender glance of assurance, and an open mind to the challenges of life are the simple things that bring joy and meaning to our existence. There must be love, peace, unders

Let each of these developing economies, such as India, China, etc. create consumers in their own countries for the products and services they create in their country.

For developed counries, offshoring jobs and services abroad for cheap labor and import products for local consumption does not help anyone. It's destroying the consumer base, which will be endangered if this process goes on.
