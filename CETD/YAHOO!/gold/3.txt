31 cities’ tap water has cancer-causing hexavalent chromium, study says
By Brett Michael Dykes

The Environmental Working Group released a report Monday indicating that millions of Americans are regularly drinking hexavalent chromium, made famous in the film "Erin Brockovich" as a carcinogen, through their tap water.
The group -- whose study was first reported in a story Sunday by the Washington Post's Lyndsey Layton -- tested water from 35 U.S. cities and found that samples from 31 cities contained hexavalent chromium. The highest concentrations were found in Norman, Okla.; Honolulu; and Riverside, Calif. The substance had been a widely used industrial chemical for decades and has evidently leached into the groundwater in many areas.

The EWG report states:
"Despite mounting evidence of the contaminant's toxic effects, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has not set a legal limit for chromium-6 in tap water and does not require water utilities to test for it. Hexavalent chromium is commonly discharged from steel and pulp mills as well as metal-plating and leather-tanning facilities. It can also pollute water through erosion of natural deposits.
"The authoritative National Toxicology Program (NTP) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said that chromium-6 in drinking water shows 'clear evidence of carcinogenic activity' in laboratory animals, increasing the risk of gastrointestinal tumors. Just last October, a draft review by the EPA similarly found that ingesting the chemical in tap water is 'likely to be carcinogenic to humans.' Other health risks associated with exposure include liver and kidney damage, anemia and ulcers."

Drinking-water supplies all over the country are increasingly tainted by chemicals used in natural gas drilling. And Erin Brockovich, for her part, told the EWG that she's rather astonished to find that hexavalent chromium is still a prospective health threat in so many communities.

"It is sometimes difficult to understand why I still have to warn the public about the presence of hexavalent chromium in drinking water 23 years after my colleagues and I first sounded the alarm," Brockovich told the EWG. "This report underscores, in fairly stark terms, the health risks that millions of Americans still face because of water contamination."
The list of cities found to have hexavalent chromium in the municipal water supplies are as follows:
• Honolulu, HI
• Bend, OR
• Sacramento, CA
• San Jose, CA
• Los Angeles, CA
• Riverside, CA

Every chemical is cancerous, and chemical is in almost everything these days. Sure it's a small amount but imagine living until 80 years old and using soap, shampoo, perfume, 15 cosmetics, etc. a day, everyday.

Everything in this planet has toxins in it. The key word is: BALANCE. Our body is able to handle many "toxins", since it is also made out of "toxins." If you think that animals have to drink from any kind of water, polluted by oil spills, trash, dangerous chemical, plus the natural bacteria, viruses, pollen, bugs, frogs,etc. or PEOPLE all around the world, you might re-consider your fright and phobia of your H2O of your kitchen sink. I am not saying, that the quality shall not or could not be improved, but come on, we all have to die of something....Also, it is a great advertisement of plastic bottled water, which is not really better for the environment, and who knows where the water is coming from anyway.

Also when they test animals for a product to cause cancer they are using extremely concentrated amounts of that product. Not to mention if you wash your dishes you will have trace amounts of the carcinogen on them and if you use tap water in cooking its in your food too. So now even water in large amounts is bad for you considering we are all around 80% water.

All of the above indicate that everyone would benefit from chromium supplementation. Most of the scientific studies on chromium, and most clinical nutritionists and health therapists, recommend that for optimal pre

According to Veronica Palmer, Vice President of Research and Development at Veridian Dynamics Corp., chromium is used in many of it's products like: WOW!" an energy drink using waste water containing large amounts of chromium from companies that produce dies, paints and stainless steel.
She claims chromium on humans will cause the body to produce large amounts of sweat to give others the impression that you work out a lot; increase the sheen on bald men's heads; reduce the chance of any body organs to corrode; enlarge the heart to increase blood capacity; eliminates acne in teens though it also increases rapid skin aging and wrinkles; and much, much more....
Extensive testing, using both Democratics and Republicans public officials, are inconclusive. It was difficult to determine if chromiun was responsible for brain damage or it was just part of being a politician....

Unfortunately there were only 35 cities tested...I may be wrong, but aren't there many more cities in the good ole U.S of A?????
