The gifts keep on coming: photos and comments are here for Android!

Dec 22nd
As promised, the Android update is here for the holidays! It’s got all the same features as the new photos and comments version for the iPhone, and a couple of extra goodies: two foursquare widgets for your home screen.

The new hotness is the addition of photos and comments:

Comments make meeting up and exploring so much easier. Improve your day by telling a friend that you’re around the corner and they should swing by. Getting a last-minute comment reminding you to order the best dish saves your meal. (You can even comment on the website and from check-in links posted to Facebook and Twitter!)
Photos change everything. Share moments with friends, see a venue and dishes before you leave the house. Your cute puppy pics! (and tips with attached photos are coming in the next update)
The past comes to life. You can visit your history page on foursquare.com to see all the places you’ve been, with photos and comments preserved. Remembering is more fun than ever.
In addition, there are two exclusive Android home screen widgets: one to enable quick check-ins, and one to see your friends’ latest activity.



We’ve received a ton of great feedback from iPhone users, and have been working around the clock on this update (literally – we have one Android developer in NYC and one in Australia). We’re both extremely excited and pretty tired; hope you enjoy this!

Visit the Android marketplace now to download it (or scan this barcode).



Happy holidays from team foursquare!

P.S. Once again, we’ll have BlackBerry and WebOS in early January, and all other platforms in early 2011.

I really wish there was a businesses tab and a personal tab, so that when I'm trying to see what venues are close by my location, I don't have a bunch of "So and So's Apartment" or "Pookie's Bed" come up.

all venues categorized as home will not show in the nearby places tab. we're working to get more venues categorized correctly!

The new features (camera and comments) do not work on my Xperia X10 Mini android. I get a message that Foursquare (proces com.joelapenna.foursquared ) stopped. How can I fix this?

This is so great! My checkins quit posting to FB awhile ago and now they post and so do my badges which never posted at all before. I don't see the widgets though like it shows in the picture.

Nice update... however, adding photos from gallery fails for me. 
Is there a size limit or something?

The application of foursquare on facebook does not work with "Places I check in to" work as a normal application, so it is not possible to share lists with friends. The Gowalla works well with "Places I check in to. " What is the solution?

There is no foursquare integration with Facebook Places. You can post your foursquare check-ins to your Facebook wall/newsfeed though!

Then I have no form of sharing my foursquare check-in with just a list of friends?

well...foursquare itself is an edited list of friends. you can curate which Facebook friends you want to see your wall (where foursquare check-ins show). for now, those are the sharing options we offer.

Great update, except that the widgets are barely functional. Foursquare Places widget either shows Loading... for ages, or it gets few options and then never updates them - I could move elsewhere and the suggestions are all old and not actual anymore.

Go to an empty home screen, tap and hold, and then click on widget from the menu that pops up. You'll see two options for foursquare--the one you click on will be added to your home screen!
