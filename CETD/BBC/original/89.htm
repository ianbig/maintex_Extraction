						<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12033946">The CBI has predicted</a> that base rates will start to go up in the spring, reaching 2.75% by the end of 2012. This has generally been greeted as bad news. But, as some will add, as an after-thought - it's good news for the hordes of people in the UK who live on the income from their savings, or are planning to do so in the next few years. </p>

<p>For them, 2010 has been a peculiarly terrible year. And it won't be so much better when base rates - Bank Rate - is back at 2.75%. Until this crisis, official interest rates had not been below 3% for generations. </p>

<p>Usually, there would be some comfort, for savers, in record-low interest rates - that at least inflation was not going to be eating into your cash. After all, don't interest rates go up, when inflation does? But not this year; that's what I mean by cruel and unusual. In a year in which savings accounts offer well below 3% interest, the TPI index of prices - which includes the impact of tax changes - has risen by nearly 5%. </p>

<p>One of the Bank of England's Deputy Governors, <a href="http://www.channel4.com/news/bank-of-england-savers-should-eat-into-cash">Charlie Bean, got into trouble a little while ago, when he suggested</a> to savers that they ought to be "eating into" their cash reserves to get through this period. On that occasion, the reporter took the side of savers. What is striking, to me, is how rarely that happens. </p>

<p>In Japan, they say that one of the reasons that deflation could continue as long as it did was that there was a large, and political influential part of the population that benefited from falling prices. Most pensions were fixed in nominal terms, and the value of a given pot of savings goes up in real terms when prices fall, even if interest rates are zero. So for older people, deflation meant rising real incomes. Only when the law was changed, to allow index-linked pensions to go down in cash terms as well as up did the government start to come under real popular pressure to reflate.<br />
 <br />
As the baby boomers prepare for their retirement, you might have expected the same kind of shift in the centre of gravity to occur in the UK. As David Willets describes in his book Pinch, through their lives, the baby boomers have been good at imposing their priorities and interests on the population at large. But on this issue, it seems that the zeitgeist is a few steps behind. </p>

<p>The average baby boomer is a net saver, these days - and certainly the average voter is a saver, given the much greater chance of older people bothering to vote. Yet we still feel and sound like a nation of borrowers: low interest rates are good, higher interest rates are almost always bad. Then again, perhaps that's for the best. Even if the economy does recover as the CBI and the government expect, the Bank of England will be punishing savers - and rewarding borrowers - for quite a long time to come. </p>

That may be classed as an interest rate issue, but really it's just another company using the economic crisis as an excuse to fleece its customers and ramp up profit margins - which is basically what price inflation is.</p>

This has generally been greeted as bad news. But, as some will add, as an after-thought - it's good news for the hordes of people in the UK who live on the income from their savings...well, no.

Typically, by the third year of a recovery, growth would be more robust than CBI is projecting.<br>Regarding interest rates, the CBI said that these will start from the spring and will rise "gently" from the current record low of 0.5%, increasing until mid-2012.<br>It says that the Bank of England will need to increase rates TO TACKLE INFLATION, which it says will remain high due to both higher energy bills and the VAT rise from 17.5% to 20%.<br>Interest rates go up; inflation goes up.<br>I don't much care who says otherwise: the proof will be at the market place, and I don't mean the stock market.<br>The CBI says CPI (consumer prices index) inflation will "significantly exceed" the Bank's 2% target for a second year in 2011, before returning to about 2% in 2012. Personally, I can't see a return. I believe this is wishful thinking.<br>The most recent official figures showed that CPI inflation rose to 3.3% in November, a six-month high.<br>It's cruel and unusual, and beyond that it doesn't make much sense.<br>Do these CBI folk really know what they're talking about because personally it makes little sense to me.</p>

Whilst the individual can sell the property, turning theoretical equity into real money, it is not practicable for more than a tiny proportion of the national housing stock to be monetised in this way. Therefore, at any given time, the value of the housing stock is theoretical - and capable of falling - whereas mortgages are 'real' liabilities. <br><br>The FSA recently proposed tight lending criteria to prevent a repeat bubble, and that is good in principle. But we have to consider how to unwind the bubble that we already have. Inflation is probably the only way of doing this, as it erodes the real value of debts.    <br></p>

It will then step up the pace of increases to end that year with a rate of 2.75% (still rather small). <br>CBI Chief Economic Adviser Ian McCafferty: “The persistent strength of energy and commodity prices is a growing concern, as it is likely to mean that inflation DOES NOT FALL BACK quite as sharply as many hope. Growth at the start of 2011 is likely to be very sluggish, although we do expect the recovery itself to stay on track.” <br>In other words, The Bank of England's raising interest rates will not necessarily curb inflation; in fact, are NOT likely to curb inflation. <br>Bank of England policy makers REMAIN DEVIDED over the need to curb inflation or increase bond purchases to counteract the effect on the economy of the government’s deficit reduction schemes. <br>Inflation is already excellerating to 3.3% in November, surpassing the government’s 3 percent limit for a ninth month. So, initially the Government erred in its estimate.<br>Inflation will end 2012 at 2.4 percent%. I can't believe this when it's excellerating now at 3.3% AND INTEREST RATES ARE GOING UP! I estimate inflation by the end of 2012 at (minimum) double the 3.3 figure. That's a big difference.<br>The CBI said the economy will grow 0.6 percent in the current quarter before slowing to 0.2 percent in the first three months of 2011. Growth will average 2 percent in 2011, it said, and accelerate to 2.4 percent in 2012. I don't know where this growth will come from. Is production expected to go up? Manufacturing? Exports?<br>It also forecasts house prices will fall about 4% next year and remain unchanged in 2012. Gross mortgage lending fell 5% to 11.1 billion pounds ($17.2 billion) in November. A separate report based on data from six mortgage lenders showed that banks granted 45,000 loans to buy homes last month, compared with 44,000 in October -  less than half the peak of the property boom in 2007. This sector is not on the rise either; in fact, seems fairly stagnant to me.<br>The Bank of England left its emergency bond-purchase plan unchanged at 200 billion pounds this month and kept the rate at a record low 0.5%. <br>MPC member Adam Posen has called for the bank to increase stimulus. He also said that policy makers shouldn’t “overreact” to inflation, as it may slow below 1% in two years. <br>His colleague Andrew Sentance, by contrast, has voted to increase interest rates since June. <br>Does it seem to you, as it seems to me, that no one has his/her finger on the pulse of UK economics.<br>What's going on?<br>Who really runs the UK economy?<br>Is it possible...I mean is it really possible that the investment banks too big to fail... run the UK economy and get subsidized for doing so?</p>

Low inflation in the late 90s and the past decade was entirely due to manufacturing and production :<br><br>a) being transferred to China, which was competing on its low labour rates, generated by its two tier internal apartheid between country and city dewllers, not only the now constantly mentioned undervalued Yuan.  But also,<br><br>b) manufacturing and production scaling up to a global scale while costs were also being driven down by automation and robotics.  Unfortunately not much of this highly efficient global manufacturing was located in Britain, and when it was, it was by foreign owned car companies, such as Nissan in Sunderland.<br><br> Unfortunately nobody else at the time seemed to see terrifying risks, particularly the economists.  They worshipped the inflation figures produced by any statistical body, so long as it appeared that everybody was living in a world of plenty.   It was so obvious to intelligent people born before 1965 (and therefore got to see Britain's and other national economies before 1990)that the world was skewed:  food was so cheap that Britain's DEFRA asked the question, "Why should Britain bother to grow food if we have so many crises like BSE, Foot and Mouth, and Blue Tongue disease etc."<br><br>Now Mervyn King is still in the job he took over from Eddie George, but he didn't see the problems coming either.

You have to wonder!   No, they don't bother looking at the real world, that's why they get it wrong!   If they had been going to the tips and dumps all over the country they would have been seeing where all the magical GDP was going - beautiful new furniture, electrical appliances, kitchens etc going to the dump because they weren't good enough, according to the Interior Decorators (even on the BBC) who ruled fashion at the time..  Drug consumption focussing entirely on cocaine, which was expensive, and foregoing cheaper alternatives like alcohol.<br><br><br>Now Stephanie is giving the naive an explanation of savings and interest rates and inflation rates for the minor adjustments that will be made next year.   Just what they need to be fed.   Never mind the fact that Japan and Britain differ for a host of other reasons - including the fact that the Japanese have so much technology in their industries that they could create deflation by exporting their way to it.  The Japanese exported, the Yen went higher, their imports became cheaper.   Britain would take about 10 years to reach that stage, because quite apart from the lack of already world-beating industries, there is a pre-ponderance of an uncompetitive unproductive workforce that can only increase its productivity by letting Sterling sink.  What else could you expect after 13 years of that excuse for a Government, where the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister were running two separate governments?  By comparison, today's coalition is a far more unitary and purposeful government than the previous one that caused damage to its Party for years to come.<br><br></p>

With unemployment expected to increase further and too many families struggling to make ends meet, I fail to understand what can a base rate increase possibly do for us? Soaking additional extra money from already hard pressing families can only increase repossessions and related loan default trouble that banks would prefer to avoid. This medicine of rate increase feels like medieval medicine, i.e. drain the patients blood to get read of the disease. It is effective medicine: it keels the patient. </p>

People taking on big mortgages in 1999 saw their investment triple.  Remember a few years ago when the yearly rise in the value of people's property was more than their yearly salary?  Now that the market is moving in the other direction, the government steps in, because presumably a fall of prices of say just 50% would presumably cause the entire banking system and economy to go under (even though a fall of 50% would be entirely reasonable after a tripling of prices).

Are you both a double act?<br>You both write these headlines to get a response on your blog. I'm not sure how much you believe of your own economics spin.<br>My view is that interest rates will rise when and if the USA put up their rates because our currencies are inter-connected.<br><br>We know that the toxic debt that the banks took on has an average maturity of about 7 and a half years from 2007 so no real recovery of bank debt will take place before 2014-2015.<br>I'm puzzled by the fact that only the BOE can set base rates (although I accept there can be political pressure for them to do so) and that they have kept them extra-ordinarily low for two years. The BOE is supposedly responsible for keeping headline inflation rate below 2% and they have FAILED for the last 8 months. The only "sanction" from the Government is for the BOE to write a billet-doux to the Chancellor!<br>This is not grown up government and it fools no one.<br><br>Make no mistake, Stephanie, we have not begun to de-leverage our debt (public or private it's still debt), the austerity cuts have not started yet and inflation of commodities is rampant (see China).<br>The USA haven't admitted that they have a debt problem yet -they are in denial and when they do try and do something about their indebitedness to 90 countries around the world, the dollar will collapse and it will take the pound with it.<br>I predict that in 2011 at least one major high-street bank will collapse and will have to be wound-up.</p>

Why should I ? paid the rent - got the place repaired , never any thought of 'inheritance' just somewhere to live . Got married and looked at the possibility of buying . Had to put a deposit down and could't afford more than 2 1/2 times salary . Here's the rub - couldn't afford to buy in town where I worked , had to buy 15 miles away and travel. So a car was de rigueur - extra cost . <br>However the mortgage was my only debt ( bought old bangers that lasted a year each then got rid of them) . <br>Now my lads are in debt to the state for their education ( mine came free ) and they have become inured to debt - just another fact of life . We have created a debt mentality - when borrowing ( even if you may have to pay back one day ) as you start out on your independent life is seen as acceptable. <br>Is this borrowing really worth it ?. For the boys - not really . The place is awash with graduates ( especially with 2.5 million out of work )so there's no real advantage there . For me - payed off the house and put what little extra in savings - being eroded by greater than official inflation, having spent thousands ( far more than the equity on my property at the moment )on just paying the interest off ( and home improvements ) let alone the capital - not at all . The boys will have a half share in a property the value of which will not really help them greatly . <br>All the money I handed over to the financial institutions would have been better spent on providing a higher standard of living for the family - not filling their coffers , remember a house is not a cash cow but somewhere to live . Thatcher and her ilk duped the people into believing that houses were cash and led us all like lambs to be fleeced by her cronies in the city . <br>If all that wealth had gone into creating real jobs then perhaps that wouldn't have been too bad - but no - she then sold off our utilities so her city friends could make a killing , so we were fleeced twice over . So having followed her principles until the wheel came off they have come to fleece us for a third time .<br>The point is ( at last I hear you cry ) what sort of system have we left for our young - desperate in my view - and perhaps with the realization of the iniquities inherent in our legacy they are beginning to say no - we want a fairer deal - look at the recent protests against a debt which could have been reduced if the city had paid all its taxes and given a little back to those of us who have filled their pockets for so long .  <br></p>
