						<p><a href="http://www.rogerfederer.com/en.html">Roger Federer</a> may have book-ended the season with big prizes - the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/andymurray/7118544/Australian-Open-2010-Andy-Murray-undone-by-brilliance-of-Roger-Federer.html">Australian Open </a>in January and the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/federer-turns-the-tables-on-nadal-in-grand-finale-2146285.html">Tour finale </a>in November - but his achievements, while substantial, are overshadowed in the final reckoning by what came in between.</p>

<p>2010 belonged to <a href="http://www.rafaelnadal.com/">Rafael Nadal</a>. An amazing season, almost impossible to repeat, included<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/sep/14/rafael-nadal-wins-us-open"> three successive majors</a>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/sports/tennis/blog/_/name/bodo_peter/id/5194396">three successive Masters 1000 titles on clay</a>, and - as he noted with his usual positivity - four victories over top eight players in the final week of the season.</p>

<p>He didn't win the ATP World Tour Finals but he did enough to prove the doubters of 12 months ago wrong.</p>

<p><br />
Remember,<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/more-sport/2009/11/26/nadal-left-stunned-by-davydenko-115875-21850857/"> in 2009 he failed to win a set at the O2 </a>as his knees creaked beneath him.  In 2010 the Spaniard raised his game, changed his grip and stayed fit from February to November, a considerable feat considering the physical intensity of his play and his recent injury record.</p>

<p>Now, rather than pack his bags for a holiday, Nadal intends to spend this week promoting the sport with a series of TV appearances and he'll be back on the practice court the following Monday.</p>

<p>"Thank you, see you next year, Merry Christmas," <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/9236318.stm">he said to the press on Sunday night </a>before heading off to his tapas restaurant of choice in central London.</p>

<p>For Roger Federer, the previous world number one, the plot to unseat his rival continues and, having been out-titled this season, he claimed an important victory right at the end.</p>

<p>If he is to recover some ground in the rankings - and <a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Singles.aspx">the difference between number one and two is substantial</a> by recent measures - and reclaim the major titles which have passed to Spain, he needs every edge going into the new year.</p>

<p>There are those who believe Federer has been cruising for the past couple of seasons. Not now. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE67R1CB20100828">The hiring of Paul Annacone to work as coach </a>alongside Severin Luthi has coincided with renewed burst of Swiss vigour.</p>

<p>In the final two months of the season <a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Roger-Federer.aspx?t=pa">he won three titles - Stockholm, Basel and London </a>-and one or two Nadal-specific adjustments were clearly evident.</p>

<p>A few years ago he introduced the forehand drop shot into his repertoire and now we have the topspin backhand, not always his party piece, working as effectively as it ever has. In the first and third sets of the O2 final it was simply sensational.</p>

<p>A million backhands have been struck against Nadal, a consequence of playing a left-hander who likes to whip cross court, and Federer's favoured slice hasn't always worked.<br />
Low balls used to catch out Nadal, not any more. So the addition of pace and bounce, coupled with greater reliability on the so-called weaker wing, provides a fascinating twist to their tactical rivalry.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/9234797.stm">Andy Murray's topsy-turvy year ended on a considerable high </a>with his sparkling performance against Nadal in the semis. Like many of his previous contests with the Spaniard, it was full of attacking intent and the sort of "let's-do-this-at-the-majors" aggression required.</p>

<p>Murray ends the year as he started it; playing with great clarity of thought. The way he played against Nadal is the way he wants to play all the time. That will be music to the ears of his many supporters who believe he can fulfil his potential if he shows the same belief in his ability as they have.</p>

<p>The shot he played at 6-6 in the final tie-break against Nadal was an indication. He missed it, but he went for it. Good luck to anyone who backs themselves. Next time he won't miss it.</p>

<p><br />
As his <a href="http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-sport/article-23861365-andy-murray-reveals-why-he-axed-miles-maclagan.do">former coach Miles Maclagan </a>said during the week on 5 Live Sports Extra's coverage from the O2, none of the greats got where they did by sitting back and waiting for mistakes up the other end.</p>

<p>Another exciting and, hopefully, profitable year is ahead for the British man.</p>

<p>So the top four in the world - and a notable mention at this point for Novak Djokovic, who represented himself superbly in London despite<a href="http://www.daviscup.com/news/newsarticle.asp?articleid=17427"> the forthcoming Davis Cup final in Belgrade</a> - contested a memorable finals weekend. But earlier, the group phase had stumbled to a disappointing conclusion.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g6RFAbw6tSTHZESCu0wyj1y_Njrw?docId=CNG.0c72364653fa48fde37dd48eded0946e.1111">lacklustre Andy Roddick waved the white flag across the net to Djokovic </a>in the final round-robin match. At least that's how it felt.</p>

<p>For a man who needed to win in straight sets, Roddick appeared unusually reserved - certainly a surprise to Djokovic who had prepared for the match by getting the young German, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Kamke">Tobias Kamke</a>, to relentless serve and volley at him.</p>

<p>Only one of the 12 round-robin matches went to three sets, and <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5gQDq0kkKPKu-svAKzHHtNGSK8MTw?docId=N0214591290467229043A">Roddick v Nadal</a> was no classic. There were several close first sets - Federer v Soderling, Nadal v Djokovic, Nadal v Berdych - but too often we found one player firing beneath full capacity. Similarly, <a href="http://www.barclaysatpworldtourfinals.com/News/Tennis/2010/Tournament/London-Final-Diary.aspx">the O2 Arena was far from full for many sessions.</a></p>

<p>Having said that, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/9221870.stm">Ferrer versus Soderling</a>, the least attractive of the group matches, was still watched by more than 14,000 people - a significant achievement on a cold winter's night - and the organisers showed the sort of gumption lacking elsewhere in the world by launching various last-minute promotions to boost sales.</p>

<p>It was another well-staged, well-attended event which brought tennis into the UK mainstream again.</p>

<p>Finally, a congratulatory mention for some sharp eyes; there were exactly 100 challenges to <a href="http://www.hawkeyeinnovations.co.uk/">Hawkeye </a>during the tournament and the decision of the officials was upheld 76 times.</p>

<p>And in a year when he sat in the umpire's chair for three days watching the same match (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/8759545.stm">Isner/Mahut at Wimbledon</a>), it was fitting that the world's consistently best official, Sweden's <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Mohamed-Lahyani/42852230027">Mohamed Lahyani</a>, took charge of the final match.</p>

As a lifetime tennis fan I am delighted to be able to attend this fabulous event in London but there are one or two things I and many of the people sitting near me when I attended last week wish were different. The seats are cramped in every direction for anyone over 5ft 7ins. It is rather like sitting in a RyanAir jet. Secondly, it seems there is no limit to the amount of food and drink people can bring in and consume during a match, or the amount of noise they can generate while doing so. With a ticket+travel cost of over £100 this can become a deeply frustrating distraction. Thirdly, and most frequently mentioned by the extensive sample of thirteen international tennis afficionados questioned, the razamataz is silly and downright annoying, especially the loud rock music played in every break, even during match end changeovers. The people playing this obviously think they have targeted their audience well by playing old Rolling Stones hits but what they don't get is that people who remember these songs from forty years ago would rather have a little peace and quiet during the match. <br>If you'd be kind enough to pass these thoughts on to the organisers I and a few thousand others would be grateful, and might attend again next year! <br>Finally let me endorse your remark about Andy Murray and that fantastic shot he played at 6-6 in the tie-break. It showed, at last, that Andy does know what he has to do to win the big one - and that next time there is a very good chance it will go in.</p>

Federer has played really really well this week, but let's not forget he hasn't won a GS final against Nadal since Wimbledon '07. Nor is he likely to, in my opinion. He's not getting any younger, and the number of players who can realistically expect to beat him when at their best has increased (Soderling and Berdych in addition to Murray and Djoko). If Rafa can stay fit, he'll be the top player in the next couple of years.<br><br>The problem with Muzza and Djoko is that they lack consistency. Very good players but by no means great. Having said that, I believe both of them will win a GS (let's not forget Djoko already has one under his belt), with the Aussie Open probably being their best shot. I'd love to say these two, as well as Mighty DelPo, Cilic, and Berdych mount a stronger challenge. <br><br>All in all, should be a very exciting 2011. Bring on the Aussie Open!</p>

The standard was much lower than that seen in the semifinals.  Almost everyone who loves tennis had been looking forward to seeing these two great players battle it out again after their unforgettable final at Wimbledon in 2008.  Instead we were treated to a dismal game in which Nadal was clearly exhausted from the brilliant semi-final with Andy Murray. He often moved slowly or sometimes not at all, preferring not even to try to reach difficult shots.  This is completely out of character.  Just as in Hamburg when Federer beat Nadal on clay for the first time, Nadal lost while fatigued and playing well below his best.  Of course, Federer's game plan was better and he stuck to it, while Nadal thought he could score cheap points by relentlessly attacking Fed's backhand, and failed to adjust to the fact that Federer was dealing with this so well.  But Nadal was dead beat before the first ball was struck, and that's a real shame.<br><br>My recommendation: Let's find a way to introduce an obligatory day off for both players before the final of all tournaments. It would be so much better if we could see them battle it out when both players are fully fit.</p>

A 24-year old nadal played the afternoon match against world number 5 then, Murray.<br>so, why are some fans blaming Nadal's loss on fatigue????<br>Can't Nadal lose again fair and square????<br>This same Murray that took Nadal to the brinks was promptly dispatched by Federer in straight sets 6-4,6-2.<br>It pains me when people see the obvious and still choose to give excuses.<br>Nadal lost in Shanghai in the 3rd round and didn't play any tournament just because he wanted the WTF title real bad. Whereas, Federer played in all the tournaments leading to the WTF. <br>Who is supposed to be the fresher player taking into account age and number of tournaments played leading to the WTF?<br>The real answers are there for a true tennis fan.<br>Kudos to Nadal for a wonderful season by all standards, albeit, he still needs to conquer the best tennis players in a single tournament.<br>Note that this is the 3rd time Federer is winning the WTF without losing a match (dominance)and he has won it a record 5 times.<br>Kudos to Federer for rescuing his season and proving that he is still there to compete with the young ones (5-6 years his junior).<br>He is by far the most talented (complete) tennis player the world has ever seen or known.<br>Every sportsman losses just as they win. so, let us keep out the excuses and enjoy tennis.<br>Thank you.</p>

The foreign press haven’t exactly gone all “GAGA” over this win. Yes it will do Fed’s confidence some good, but all this talk of “Nadal-specific adjustments” is all just hype. <br><br>The indoor court’s made for the FedEx’s game. With Nadal unable to generate his signature “high top spin” he utilises,  it was evident his trajectories were low and slow enough for Federer to ponce upon, control and hit his angles anywhere he saw fit, which he did superbly. Making the final for Nadal was an achievement in itself, a win against the greatest player of his era and indoors (at that), a bonus and no more! Let’s not forget that a clearly fatigued Nadal still took a set off Fed, a point Nadal was quick to point out in his interview. That will “hurt” Fed (who’d up to that point had pretty much strolled through his rounds without dropping a set), especially as Nadal wasn’t full of his usual running. <br><br>Still, I’d rather a competitive and confident Federer any day as the game is poorer when he’s not. Hopefully 2011 will herald much more competitive matches between these two great rivals and throw Djokovic and Murray in the mix and we could be in for another blockbuster season.<br><br>Rant: This World Tour final format is just a cynical money making event in terms of how they’ve come up with 3 ways (round robin) to make money out of the same player. Why on earth it awards 1500/1000 ranking points to the finalists is a joke!! I’d rather watch an open field (Masters 1000 format) involving a wider field of the world’s top 32 players. At least we’d have more variety than the predictable outcomes we’ve had to put up with. There were probably 3 stand out matches all week, which is a poor return if you ask me! (Rant over)!<br></p>

Reliable backhand top spin, defensive and attacking, mixed with occasional slices during rallies.<br>3. Inside out backhand down the line in the middle of a backhand crosscourt rally. Fed therefore runs less, is more sharp and is now back as serious contender for majors. Well done Fed, and Paul Annacone!! Wow!</p>

But a lad called Andrew Murray came along, I was made correspondent, and suddenly in 2009 tennis is the most exciting sport to work in - Fred Perry, 1936 and all that. A job was invented to travel the world watching sport. Genius. I do it. Love it. You can also follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/5livetennis">Twitter</a><br /><br />
