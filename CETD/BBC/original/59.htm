						<p>Another year, another £60m outlay. More promises, more plans.  </p>

<p>And the usual answers to the standard questions: "We're heading in the right direction...  give us time..."</p>

<p>Groundhog day at the National Tennis Centre, the unfailingly spotless home of the <a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/">Lawn Tennis Association</a>, where the annual accounts of the governing body were revealed on Wednesday accompanied by the annual plea for patience.</p>

<p>£59m was earned during 2010, up almost £3m on last year, with the majority coming, as usual, from the generous folk up the road at Wimbledon.</p>
						


						
						     <div id="more" class="asset-more">

<img alt="British junior George Morgan" src="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jonathanoverend/morgan_getty595.jpg" width="595" height="335" class="mt-image-none" style="" /><p style="width:595px;font-size: 11px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">At 17, Bolton's George Morgan is among the crop of current British hopefuls </p></div>Expenditure included £10m on business support, £3m on commercial, £16m on competitions and events, £13m on growth and development and another £13m on talent. £60m in total, a loss of just under £1m.

<p><br />
The <a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/BlueprintUpdate">LTA, defending the expenditure, says definite progress is being made</a>.</p>

<p>The number of adults playing weekly is up above 500,000 for the first time, the number of juniors regularly competing is above 41,000 and the number of juniors "on track" for a professional career is also up (31 in 2010 compared with 26 last year).</p>

<p>There are new sponsorship deals, more indoor courts, and the long-awaited surge of tennis equipment and educational tools into primary schools. </p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/Players/Rising-Stars/">healthy crop of junior talent </a>- "more depth than before" according to chief executive Roger Draper - backs up a successful year for several British women, especially the inspiring <a href="http://www.elena-baltacha.com/">Elena Baltacha</a>, 55 in the world, and the promising <a href="http://www.heatherwatson.co.uk/">Heather Watson</a> whose transition from the junior ranks appears to be going impressively to plan (175 in the world already).  </p>

<p>But the <a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/Rankings/Singles.aspx?d=13.12.2010&c=GBR&r=0">ranking figures on the men's side </a>continue to let the side down. If progress is being made in so many areas (and it clearly is) how can this simple rankings fact be explained: In 2006, there were nine British men inside the top 300 and three inside the top 100. In 2010 there are only three inside 300 and just <a href="http://www.andymurray.com/">Andy Murray</a> inside 100?  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2006/dec/24/tennis.news">Over four years, since the arrival of the current regime at the top of the LTA</a>, men's tennis - including the Davis Cup team - has unquestionably gone backwards.</p>

<p>April's <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/daviscup/7392803/Davis-Cup-Great-Britain-suffers-new-tennis-low-with-defeat-in-Lithuania.html">Davis Cup defeat in Lithuania</a> was an all-time low - the lack of talent beneath Andy Murray cruelly exposed - and led to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/mar/17/john-lloyd-resigns-davis-cup-captain">the "departure" of captain John Lloyd</a>. It also signalled <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/mar/17/john-lloyd-resigns-davis-cup-captain">the end for coach Paul Annacone</a>, who finally left the organisation in September to coach Roger Federer. The era of celebrity coaches at the NTC had come to an end.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/tennis/2304050/Brad-Gilbert-nets-juicy-return-from-LTA.html">Brad Gilbert</a> and <a href="http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL0287837520080402">Peter Lundgren</a> before them, Lloyd and Annacone were on extremely healthy contracts. A vast amount of money has left British tennis in the past three years to resolve these deals. Money well spent? Yes, says Draper, brushing aside the rankings history.</p>

<p>But how many indoor courts could have been built with just a fraction of the cash dished to the celebrity quartet?</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this matter wasn't discussed during the speeches at the AGM. Contract pay-offs must appear somewhere within the balance sheet, we just don't know where.  Perhaps under "developing and supporting talent".</p>

<p>As the speeches continued, and they tend to drone on at these kind of functions, I decided to escape to the indoor courts. On the way,<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/tennis/article-1217553/Anyone-lunch-LTA-landed-500-000-free-meals.html"> a pit stop at the canteen for a famous LTA coffee </a> and a hello to a few familiar faces.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Wa/J/James-D-Ward.aspx">James Ward, the British number two</a>, had just come off court with his coach, and fellow Arsenal fanatic, Greg Rusedski.</p>

<p>Ward, 201 in the world, will probably be the number one player in the Davis Cup team when Tunisia visit in March so this is a big season ahead for the Londoner.</p>

<p>He's got a wild card into the Sydney International at the start of the year - a great chance to win a couple of matches at ATP level and take that ranking upwards!</p>

<p>Good to see <a href="http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Wa/J/James-D-Ward.aspx">Jamie Baker</a> too. More injury trouble in 2010 for the unluckiest man in British tennis but he keeps at it, keeps believing. He's back at futures level for the time being so good luck to him as he grinds his way back.</p>

<p>And so to the courts where, I must confess, I watched some tennis to back up the optimism of the men in suits.</p>

<p>Seventeen-year-old <a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/In-Your-Area/Lancashire/news/December-10/George-Morgan-wins-the-Orange-Bowl/">George Morgan from Bolton, fresh from winning the prestigious Orange Bowl in Florida last week</a>, was playing Nottingham 15-year-old Luke Bambridge. I'm told they're among the hardest workers in the British junior ranks. The coaches love their attitude.</p>

<p>What impressed me most about their session, supervised by coaches <a href="http://www.lta.org.uk/News/All-news-items/2010-12-06/George-Morgan-wins-Orange-Bowl-title/">Colin Beecher</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Tideman">Magnus Tideman</a>, was the general positivity of the play. Always aggressive, always with an eye for stepping in, moving through the ball and up the court.</p>

<p>This was refreshing to see. Most of the junior tennis I've seen at the NTC over the years has been "up and down" - solid baseline stuff, nothing spectacular, a distinct shortage of collective "weapons".</p>

<p>Morgan has a monster backhand and Bambridge does damage with his forehand; a couple of useful serves too; good feel for an approach shot.</p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/apr/12/leon-smith-britain-davis-cup-captain">Davis Cup captain Leon Smith </a>looked on, I couldn't help wondering whether this was a sign of a new attacking ethos. Smith pointed out that for all the talk of slower courts and lack of net play in the modern game, rallies still only last an average of 4-6 shots. It's all about taking opportunities and pouncing on chances when they appear. Good to hear.</p>

<p>Smith now heads up the coaching team on the men's side and, along with Beecher and other committed LTA staffers, has seen the celebrity coaching era come and go. Now is the time to invest in British coaches, the bedrock of the sport in this country. </p>

<p>As <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00x3p8x/5_live_Sport_Roger_or_Rafa_who_is_the_greatest/">Tony Nadal said on 5 Live the other night,</a> there is no miracle cure or proven scientific solution to coaching tennis players. Whatever people may say, Smith and Beecher have as good a shot as Gilbert and Annacone of producing champions. And they're a damn sight cheaper.</p>

<p>Tideman, the Swede, will be coaching Morgan this season as he takes the first few steps out of the junior ranks and into the big wide world of the senior game. A big job.</p>

<p>This crucial transition period can make or break a player but the LTA are keener than ever not to rush these kids. Patience will be the key. At least with Kyle Edmund, Liam Broady and Oliver Golding, Morgan spearheads an impressive crop of British juniors. Good luck to them all next season.</p>

<p>On the adjacent courts, a few 10-year-olds from the <a href="http://www.aegontennis.co.uk/investing-in-talent/future-stars/index.htm">Aegon Future Stars</a> programme were merrily hitting away.</p>

<p>I love the innocence of these kids. The racquets always look way too big, the angle of the serve makes it look trigonometrically impossible to clear to the net. </p>

<p>They may not make it, they may not even be playing in a couple of years, but it's always  invigorating to watch young kids playing sport. And, make no mistake, there were some classy touches from Cameron Kerr (Renfrewshire), Kai Maxted (Sussex) and Boris Ivanyuzhenkov (London). </p>

<p>Good luck to them (keep at it!), although this radio commentator politely invites a colleague to take over before little Boris makes his Wimbledon debut!</p>

In order to achieve higher standards tennis needs to capture the imagination of young people at a very young age. This is done not by hoping to find one exceptional junior(though it helps)but by building a bedrock of adults playing either social or competitive tennis. If the clubs are proactive in trying to make the tennis club a social hub so the children of the adults see the tennis club as a friendly and aspirational place to be. This will allow a greater cross section of the available youth to be exposed to tennis. It is a simple numbers game which allows the game to draw from a bigger pool. Given the climate in this country more indoor centres are needed but not necessarily local authority or commercial centres. A significant proportion of that £60 million should be spent assisting ambitious clubs to provide indoor facilities whether air domes or more permanent structures. With supported outreach into the local schools tennis can become a mainstream sport in the locality. This will also provide a career path into coaching for those who don't want to compete. There are still too many tennis clubs who function on the principle that children are a nuisance who should be ejected from the clubhouse as soon as possible.</p>

Though they may not be the best in the world at tennis am sure they've worked hard and continue to do so, as well as sacraficing a lot to get to the position they are now, even if its not as high as they or we might hope. I agree that in our culture now we do have a large number who want everything for nothing, but its unfair to tarnish everyone with the same brush.<br>We aren't the only country struggling to find talented youngsters at the present time, the USA are also going through a lean period, though not the same extent as us though they do have a far greater population. The emergence of more players from eastern European countries has probably hindered our players position in the rankings. Ten years ago they probably would have been higher up than they are now but face far greater competition theese days.<br>A big problem i find with this country is the pressure we put all our youngsters under as soon as we see any sort of talent, this can't help them to get better. They need to be able to develop with freedom and allowed to find enjoyment in the game. This not only applies to tennis, but also the likes of football and rugby. Players in other countries are allowed to enjoy the game from a young age without so much pressure.</p>

And while I may be speaking for myself, it's the kids work ethic, allied to the incredible support and dedication from the LTA which will hopefully produce many champions from not only the ten year old group, but from the seventeen year olds all the way down. Talent = potential. Potential + hard work = results. <br><br>But please be patient, the George Morgans of this world will not be 'statistically' at their peak till their early twenties, so it's a long road to travel with many twists and turns on the way, but which I feel will produce a clutch of world class athletes over the next decade.

When future stars really come to the fore. <br><br>I think the simple explanation is that aside from these remarkable parents and children (best of luck to you!) as a whole we're too soft, too reserved, and too obsessed with education and societal structures. We have a few exceptional families like the Murrays who are prepared to follow the promise of talent and do drastic things - but they are not as numerous as others.  <br><br>Look at the hundreds of Russian and Eastern European kids who compete - they'll move towns, schools and houses to get their kids the most advantageous position. And the drive and hunger is there to see for all. <br><br>The points about tennis club structure are very good but don't take into account economics really. I can't stand the emphasis on doubles, BUT surely the majority of paying customers of the club are well-off mature people who want to play it? <br><br>Either the LTA pays for blocks of time to use the club's facilities for kids to train, or it throws loads more money at making clay courts, cheap tournament standard hard courts, and let's get things moving.        </p>

Unfortunately there are too few players coming through, and the average standard is too low. As I have written about on my "Tennis in the UK" blog ( <a href="http://uk-tennis.blogspot.com/">http://uk-tennis.blogspot.com/</a> ), the problem with British tennis is at grass roots level. The entry level for tennis in the UK is a network of private tennis clubs which are primarily run by, and for, middle-aged social tennis players, and is dominated by doubles play. Juniors ready to graduate to the adult sections of clubs find them deeply unattractive - assuming they are even made welcome at all.<br><br>I helped run a junior section for many years and saw many talented players - most of whom no longer play. Where is all the missing talent? - mostly playing other sports. What is the solution? - we need a network of tennis sports clubs orientated around singles play, coaching and competition, to complement the existing tennis social clubs.</p>

But a lad called Andrew Murray came along, I was made correspondent, and suddenly in 2009 tennis is the most exciting sport to work in - Fred Perry, 1936 and all that. A job was invented to travel the world watching sport. Genius. I do it. Love it. You can also follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/5livetennis">Twitter</a><br /><br />
