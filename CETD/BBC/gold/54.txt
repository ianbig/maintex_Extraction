"Let me propose to you that what we need to do now to console ourselves with the unhappy events that took place in Zurich (Fifa announcement), to console ourselves the logical thing to do is, of course to bid for the London Winter Olympics. "

There are 14 lighting towers reaching 70m (230ft) above the sports area. They are supporting a total of 532 individual lights, which took sometime to warm up.
