Rafael Nadal wins BBC prize

Men's tennis number one Rafael Nadal has won the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year award.
The 24-year-old Spaniard won a remarkable three Grand Slams in 2010 - the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open, as well three Masters titles.
In winning the US Open, Nadal became only the seventh man in history to complete the set of majors.
"For me it's an honour, thank you very much to the BBC for giving me this award," said Nadal.
"It's just a dream being in the list of great champions to receive this award."
	
He fights so hard on the court, he treats every match like it's going to be the last one and he's one of the best players of all time

Nadal now has nine Grand Slams, with world number two Roger Federer's haul of 16 titles in his sights.
"I think what Rafa has done at such a young age, so consistently, is quite phenomenal really and he's the best player by far in 2010," said Federer.
Last year, Nadal was beset by numerous problems including knee tendonitis, abdominal pain, a knee injury and the break-up of his parents.
The tendonitis forced him to miss Wimbledon and he subsequently dropped outside the top three in August 2009 for the first time since 2005.
