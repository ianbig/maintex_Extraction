SYNOPSIS
In this one-off special, host Les Kelly (Kevin Bishop) gives a little tinselly attention to the unsung heroes who make Britain great. Les is his usual opinionated, sincere, stupid self. The guests are mostly either mad, bad or tragic. This is the show that captures the 'we're in this together' culture, adds a bit of 'the big society' and some Seventies-style schmaltz. The 'real people' on the show include a campanologist who plays Away In A Manger with only one bell, a man campaigning for guide dogs for sighted people, and a lollipop lady with OCD.
