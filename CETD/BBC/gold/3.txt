Bitterly cold weather conditions are forecast for Wales overnight as the big freeze continues.

The Met Office has warned of icy patches on untreated roads, particularly where snow freezes.

Overnight temperatures of -3C (26.6F) are expected in Cardiff and Swansea and -8C to -10C (17.6F to 14F) for towns in Gwynedd and Conwy.

Meanwhile, flu sufferers are urged not to attend A&E departments unless absolutely necessary.

Public Health Wales said unless people's symptoms are very severe, they are pregnant or in an at-risk group, they can treat themselves at home without needing to visit emergency rooms that are already busy due to the weather.

Dr Marion Lyons of Public Health Wales, said: "Although flu is unpleasant, it usually resolves itself within a week and it is not advised that patients visit their GP surgery or A&E department.

Treacherous conditions
"This only risks spreading the infection to others, and it is unlikely that any medication will be prescribed in most cases."

Travellers have faced treacherous conditions with snow and ice in many parts of Wales.

Cardiff Airport was closed between 1700 and 1900 GMT to clear the runway.

Passengers were advised to contact their airline or tour operator for further information about specific flights before travelling to the airport.

Temperatures fell as low as -17C (1.3F) at Capel Curig in Snowdonia overnight on Sunday.

Police have warned drivers to clear all snow and ice from their windscreens and car roofs fully so snow does not slip and obscure their vision.

Drivers who ignore this warning could be prosecuted, the South Wales and Dyfed-Powys forces have warned.

Ambulance difficulties
The main A48(M) reopened in Cardiff after a fuel tanker fire on Sunday.

Meanwhile, an air ambulance crew condemned youths who pelted their helicopter with snowballs as they tried to land in Swansea on an emergency call.

Deputy First Minister Ieuan Wyn Jones, on a visit to the North Wales traffic control centre at Conwy, said: "The present arctic weather is testing the capacity of our services to the limit

"We all owe a great debt of gratitude to the men and women in our police, emergency and traffic services for their round the clock dedication."
